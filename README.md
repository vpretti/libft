<p align="center">Libft is the first project in 42. The task is to create your very own C library, wich will contaim libc functions, as well as, new functions. Besides from the functions implementations, we also made a Makefile that will create a static library, with the functions implemented. The static lib created will be used in next 42 projects.</p>
